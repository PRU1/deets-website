# What is an Artificial Neural network

An Artificial Neural Network is a network of nodes. This is designed to mirror brains, and in this analogy nodes are akin to neurons. Nodes are connected to each other and can send "signals". Nodes receive, process, and then send out those signals. A neural network itself simply takes and input and provides an output. At the fundamental level it is a type of algorithm and is not intrinsically linked to maching learning. How neural entworks process the signals received are dependent on a few parameters in the nodes, machine learning is the process of iteratively chaging those parameters to create a more accurate neural network. 

## How is this implemeneted?



Nodes are split into several layers in a neural network. The input layer, then the hidden layers, and finally the output layer. The input layer is where the data starts. The hidden layers do the actual processing, and the output layer shows the result of all the processing. The input layers Between any two connected nodes, there is a *weight* attached. This weight is often a number between 0 and 1.
